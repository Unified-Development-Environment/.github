# Introduction

Embedded systems and IoT have seen a surge in popularity in recent years, and while the hardware of these systems has seen its timely share of innovation, the software development processes and methodologies remain mostly unchanged from years ago. Its recent proliferation and extended scope to non-technical adopters has resulted in a dire need for development approaches that prioritize principles like virtualization and modularity while remaining intuitive, portable, and accessible.

In this project, we began by analyzing the existing solutions, their respective approaches, perks, and pain points. Platforms such as MakeCode, BIPES, NodeRed, and WARDuino are examined adequately. We then propose a unified HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer), which allows developers to write modular code that is compatible with a host of different embedded systems, thus bringing about the paradigm of platform independence to low-level systems. 

Furthermore, we extend this support to non-technical adopters by introducing Visual Programming within our Environment. The visual development environment allows developers to write abstracted code without worrying about low-level nuances on the target system, while also allowing for basic simulation capabilities. We demonstrate basic support for a range of systems including but not limited to STM32s (ARM M4/M7), Texas Instruments Tiva TM4C, and Arduino Uno(ATmega328). 

Together, this paradigm not only brings tremendous ease to the development process but also enables a unified way of programming microcontrollers, enhances modularity, and reduces the development overhead, expense, and the timeline of the project.
